	 *In most Poker games, the "full house" hand is defined as 
	 *three cards of the same face + two cards of the same face, 
	 *other than the first, regardless of the card's suits. 
	 *The cards faces are "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K" and "A". 
	 *The card suits are "♣", "♦", "♥" and "♠". 
	 *A special card "Joker" (denoted as "*") is used as wildcard and can replace any other card. 
	 *Jokers do not have a suite. 
	 *Jokes can be used several times in a hand. 
	 *Write a program to generate and print all full houses and print their number. 
	 Example:
	 Output
	 (2♣ 2♦ 2♥ 3♣ 3♦) … (2♣ 2♦ 2♥ 3♣ 3♦) … (2♣ 2♦ 2♥ 3♣ 3♥) … (2♣ 2♦ 2♥ 3♣ *) …
	 (2♣ * * 3♣ *) … (A♠ A♥ A♦ K♠ K♣) … (A♦ A♥ A♠ * *) … (* * * * *)
	 119808 full houses
